   1. ## <a name="_toc124598522"></a>What are ethics in the software industry
As a software engineer, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of the project and its potential impact on users and society. This includes ensuring the software is secure and does not cause harm, as well as being transparent about the handling of user data and respecting user privacy. When making decisions, a software engineer must weigh the benefits of certain features against any potential negative consequences for the users. Ethical considerations can also extend to other areas such as security, integrity, and social responsibility. It is important to carefully evaluate and address these ethical issues throughout the development process to ensure the software aligns with moral principles and values.

1. ## <a name="_toc124598523"></a>What have I done about ethics
   1. ### <a name="_toc124598524"></a>Individual project
For my individual project the only thing I thought about was the user information that is collected. For now, I only have a first name, last name, email, and password. With this information the user has an account, and I can use for example the email to inform them about the application. 


When the application is expanded to a extend where the user can log its food and weight. I need to have some more details like height, weight, number of days active in a week, and age. When adding this feature there will be an option to not use this function so the user can choose to give this information or not. 

Another part of protecting the data of the user is security. The user can only see its own data, when another user tries to access their data, it gets blocked. The only person who can see the data is the user itself and the admin. 

1. ### <a name="_toc124598525"></a>Group project
We as a group have taken ethical considerations into account while developing the "Is It Live" application for World of Content. The app is designed to assist big brands, such as Red Bull and Bullit, in determining whether their data is correctly published on supermarket websites. We collect only the data that is on the supermarket websites where the brands sell their products. 

However, there may be ethical conflicts, such as relying on potentially inaccurate data from World of Content. To address this, we have made the application as maintainable and scalable as possible and added features such as showing if the content is missing and limiting requests to prevent supermarket websites to block us. Overall, the application still provides brands with a general understanding of their data on the website and allows them to act if necessary.
1. # <a name="_toc124598526"></a>Cultural Differences
   1. ## <a name="_toc124598527"></a>What are cultural differences in software
Cultural differences in software refer to variations in the way software is designed, developed, and used in different cultures or regions. These differences can be influenced by factors such as language, customs, and business practices. For example, software developed for the Chinese market may have different user interface elements and features to accommodate the use of Chinese characters, while software developed for the US market may not. Cultural differences can also affect the way software is tested and marketed, as well as user expectations and preferences.

Also, when working in a software team you can find sometimes multiple cultures. You need to know how to work together in a professional way. Sometimes people think differently than you because of their culture. You need to respect this and think on how you can meet at common ground. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124598528"></a>What is my culture
I did a culture test to see my primary culture type: guilt, shame, or fear. Here I got asked 25 questions and answered them honestly. The results say that I am mostly guilt. This I most common in western society where I am currently staying. 


1. ## <a name="_toc124598529"></a>My personal experience with cultural differences
   1. ### <a name="_toc124598530"></a>MBO ICT
When I was studying ICT at ROC De Leijgraaf in Veghel, my classmates had different backgrounds than just Dutch. In my project group I had 1 from Turkey and 2 from Morocco. I never had any problems with different cultures. When we did our project, it was Ramadan, occasionally they came a bit later because they slept less, which was not always easy with stand-ups, because you want to know what everyone is going to do in a day and what everyone is doing. When three group mates are not there, that is difficult to fill in. As a result, there were some inequalities within the group. We had resolved this by sitting down with each other to clear all frustration and problems, then we made arrangements together to make it as pleasant as possible for everyone. So, they also were allowed to work online at home, have an extra standup in the afternoon and above all communicate with each other if there is something. After we made these arrangements, we worked much more effectively, and we really started working again and ended the project with a good grade.

1. ### <a name="_toc124598531"></a>Internship Digital Agency JaxX
During my internship at Digital Agency JaxX, I worked in a team with all women. This was no problem as the connection was good. In this internship I worked with a costumer who was from Sweden. When having meeting we discussed everything in English. He wanted a website for his tattoo shop. He had some suggestions, but we directed him in a direction which was more in the look for the visitors in Eindhoven and surroundings. There were some things he really wanted on his site, so we kept that in. What I learned here is that you need to respect the customers wishes and find some common ground where both sides are happy. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124598532"></a>Personality tests
When working for a workshop which was about ethics and cultural differences, I made 2 personality tests. The first test is called a color test, here you give answers to several statements.

My result was the color red. This means that I am a social person. It means that I believe when you work hard and good for a company the company gives good back. I believe that if you stimulate a person the wright way, he will fulfill his destiny and bring his best out himself. 

The second test was a team role test. This was a real personality test and got asked questions where you could answer with not characteristic. somewhat characteristic, very characteristic. 

The result was that I am practical and work in a strict order. I am also someone who brings the team together and make them work. It also says that I come up with idees and that I am curious. 

For the most part I can see myself in the results, but I am not someone who comes up with idees. When there is an idee I always think about different options or try to have a different look at the idee. I can see myself in the group worker and bringing the group together to work on something because I do this often every time, I am in a team project.

1. # <a name="_toc124598533"></a>Workshop
For our workshop we had done some research about ethics with cameras in public. Here is stumbled on this article: [NOS, China bouwt ongeëvenaard surveillancesysteem, maar wel tegen een prijs](https://nos.nl/artikel/2309388-china-bouwt-ongeevenaard-surveillancesysteem-maar-wel-tegen-een-prijs). In this article they talk about a supermarket with no working staff, it all works on cameras. When entering you scan your face, and it follows you around. It tracks what you put in your shopping cart, and when leaving the store, it takes the money from your bank account. The problem with this is that you are tracked all the time. And then there are questions about who can see all the data, who is monitoring these cameras, can you deny people if they have done something wrong. When is it useful and when is it going too far to where we don’t have any privacy anymore. In my opinion this goed to far, security cams I found good with rules. Like you can’t access the cameras for nothing, you need to have a reason and approval from authorities like the police.
