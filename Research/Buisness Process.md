1. # <a name="_toc124509246"></a>What is a business process? 
A business process can be depicted as a succession of activities or tasks intended to make something of significant worth, like an item or service They can be implemented on and across all organizational levels and are often modeled as a flowchart or process matrix visualizing the sequence of the steps and their relation to each other. A business process starts with an objective or a goal (often in the form of a client request or need), and it ends with a product, service, or other result that satisfies this objective or goal.

Business process can be large or small, if the process is too large most times it is extracted into subprocesses. Most business processes can be categorized into one of these three types:

1. Operational processes: these provide the core business of producing value for the customer; providing a service or manufacturing a product. Also called the primary process. 
1. Management processes: these oversee the operational processes; for example: corporate governance, budget management, and employee oversight. Also called the secondary process. 
1. Supporting processes: these support the operational processes; for example: recruitment, technical support, and accounting.

There are 5 steps in a business process cycle: 
1. ## <a name="_toc124509249"></a>Design 
In the design phase the goal of the business process is created. In this step you think about what the process is about and what the target group is. You also think what the start and end goal is for the process. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124509250"></a>Model 
In the model phase the business process goal is made in a model. This model is made in a flowchart.  Here the image of the process is clear. The design needs approval of all the stakeholders. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124509251"></a>Execute 
This phase you execute the process. Here you put the process to the test and see if anything is missing or is unnecessary. Before really using the process, you need to test it multiple times so when it is live there are no errors. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124509252"></a>Monitor 
In the monitor phase you collect the date form your tests and examine how your critical activities are moving over time. When you have enough data then you can make KPIs. 

1. ## <a name="_toc124509253"></a>Optimize 
The fifth and last phase of the lifecycle is optimize. Based on the insights gained during the monitoring phase, you will strive to improve the process and remove bottlenecks in this phase to make your process more efficient.

In the image below is an example of a product release process. This can be used for my own project. When releasing a new product or a part of a product it is important that it meets certain standards before it can be deployed to costumers. The process contains several tasks to ensure a secure and reliable release of a part of software. 

The development section starts the process when they have created a functioning part of software that can be released for costumers. The code is then committed on a release branch and can no longer be edited. The next step is for the quality assurance section to perform unit, integration, and regression testing and a security analysis. If the release fails either of these steps, the results are sent back to the development team to be fixed. If the release passes the tests, the development team gets the notification to prepare the release for deployment. 

Then the release is sent back to the quality assurance team to perform user acceptance tests. If the tests fail the result is send back to the development team to fix them and the release starts back at the start. if the test passes the development team get a notification that the release can be deployed. Then the last task is for the marketing section to notify the user of the new release.

For our group project we have created one business processes. The process is a brand navigating from the homepage to the product page it wants to check if the content is the same.
